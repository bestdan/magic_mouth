## Magic Mouth
An [AI Support for GMs ](ai_support_for_gm.md) running D&D campaigns. 

There is generally an `AGENTS.md` in each sub-directory to explicitly describe how to support the GM. 

### Common components

**Environment**: see /environment/

**Players**: see /players/

Use for tracking player characters, for levelling encounters etc

> Update all players to Level 6 before we start the new session. FooBar is now a Chronurgy Wizard.

**Npcs**: see /npcs/

Use for tracking NPCs. 

> Add a new NPC: `Torgana Yomama` a spy from Zooma who wants to get the players to do a job. 

**Ideas**: see /ideas/

Help you brainstorm ideas for sessions, from a kernal of an idea. For example: 

> Help me create some ideas for sessions where the players have to solve a riddle to understand how the environmental dangers will change from round to round. 


**Items**: see /items/

Use for making & tracking custom-made special items etc.

> Add a new magical item for Torgana, something that will help him on defense. Legendary level. 

**Sessions**: see /sessions/

Helps you set up and run a given session. Fairly structured with templates for: 
 - setup_gm: what you as a GM need to know about running the session. Also inspects the previous sessions *notes.md* 
 - setup_players: what you might tell the players ahead of the game
 - encounter: details for the actual encounter, enemies, triggers, running the game
 - notes: where to take notes during the session
 - snak_shop: an optional example of a shop inventory for each session


> Help me set up session 7: I want to use the idea/xyz.md idea for it. There will be 4 level 6 players.
